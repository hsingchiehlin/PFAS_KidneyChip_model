# PFAS_KidneyChip_model

This repository is constructed for the paper "AN IN VITRO-IN SILICO WORKFLOW FOR PREDICTING RENAL CLEARANCE OF PFAS" and contains scripts and data for executing the PFAS-Kidney chip model. "PFAS_Kidneychip_exe_code.rmd" is the main script to reproduce results in the main manuscript (Figs. 4 - 6) and supplementary figures (Figs.S1, S3 - S5).
